To Do  -- Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.

My Reflection:

Skills involved in this project:
-created files and folders from command line
-moved in and out of folders in working directory on the command line.
-continued to work to get more comfortable with git on the command line to add/commit/push at major changes within the file structure and leave comments that make sense.
-crafted simple, yet functional web pages.
-utilized ordered lists as well as unordered lists.
-published project to github pages at https://janstander2011.github.io/odin-recipes
-managed to not misspell recipe even once on a commit....
-continued to learn to leverage VSCode and the workspaces feature.
-I am excited to become more comfortable with the command line as it's just faster than navigating through menus and clicking and typing.
